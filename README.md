## CRAN Task View Initiative <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61115545" align="right" alt="CRAN Task Views logo" width="180" />

CRAN task views aim to provide guidance which packages on the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)
are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic. They give a brief
overview of the included packages which can also be automatically installed using the
[ctv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ctv) package. The views are intended to
have a sharp focus so that it is sufficiently clear which packages should be
included (or excluded) - and they are not meant to endorse the "best" packages
for a given task.


### Installation

To automatically install the views, the [ctv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ctv)
package needs to be installed, e.g., via

```
install.packages("ctv")
```

and then the views can be installed via `install.views()` or `update.views()`
(where the latter only installs those packages which are not installed and up-to-date),
e.g.,

```
ctv::install.views("Econometrics")
ctv::update.views("Econometrics")
```

To query information about a particular task view on CRAN from within R or to
obtain the list of all task views available, respectively, the following
commands are provided:

```
ctv::ctv("Econometrics")
ctv::available.views()
```

The task views as a whole are overseen and coordinated by the _CRAN Task View
Editors_ and each individual task view is maintained by a group of volunteers.
See below for details on how to contribute to an existing task view or propose
a new one.

### How to contribute?

For contributing to an existing task view please go to the respective repository
(see links below) and follow the guidelines in [Contributing](Contributing.md).

For proposing a new task view please follow the guidelines in [Proposal](Proposal.md).

Guidelines for the maintainers of CRAN task views are provided in [Maintenance](Maintenance.md).

Technical documentation about the task view format is in [Documentation](Documentation.md).
Some more details can be found R-Forge page of the [ctv package](https://ctv.R-Forge.R-project.org/).

For other questions regarding CRAN task views as a whole, please open an issue in this repository.
