## CRAN Task View Initiative <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61115545" align="right" alt="CRAN Task Views logo" width="180" />

CRAN task views aim to provide some guidance which packages on the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)
are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic. They give a brief
overview of the included packages and can be automatically installed using the
[ctv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ctv) package. The views are intended to
have a sharp focus so that it is sufficiently clear which packages should be
included (or excluded) - and they are not meant to endorse the "best" packages
for a given task.


### Installation

To automatically install the views, the [ctv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ctv)
package needs to be installed, e.g., via

```
install.packages("ctv")
```

and then the views can be installed via `install.views()` or `update.views()`
(where the latter only installs those packages which are not installed and up-to-date),
e.g.,

```
ctv::install.views("Econometrics")
ctv::update.views("Econometrics")
```

The task views as a whole are overseen and coordinated by the _CRAN Task View
Editors_ and each individual task view is maintained by a group of volunteers.
See below for details on how to contribute to an existing task view or propose
a new one.
